Right clicking the search bar will clear it and select it for searching.  
Searching by default, will only search the item's display name. Changing the config option "searchTooltips" to true, will also search the items tooltips.  
The search bar can be hidden by pressing Ctrl + H while in a container. This can be changed in the options.
